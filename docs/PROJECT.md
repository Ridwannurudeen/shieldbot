## Problem Statement

**The DeFi security crisis on BNB Chain is costing users billions.**

In 2024 alone, over $2.3 billion was stolen through smart contract exploits, rug pulls, and honeypot tokens across all chains, with BNB Chain being a primary target due to its high trading volume and ease of token deployment. Current security solutions have critical gaps:

### Current Solutions Fall Short

1. **Post-Mortem Block Explorers** (BscScan, DexScreener)
   - Users check AFTER buying
   - No real-time intervention
   - Requires manual verification knowledge

2. **Centralized Token Scanners** (TokenSniffer, RugDoc)
   - Single-point-of-failure
   - High false positive rates
   - No transaction interception
   - Users still click "approve" on risky contracts

3. **Wallet Warnings** (MetaMask Phishing Detection)
   - Only flags known scam domains
   - Cannot analyze contract bytecode in real-time
   - No honeypot detection
   - No simulation of transaction outcomes

4. **Manual Due Diligence**
   - Time-consuming (20+ min per token)
   - Requires expertise (reading bytecode, checking liquidity locks)
   - Users skip it in FOMO situations
   - Inconsistent methodology

### The Core Problem

**Users need protection BEFORE transactions execute, not after losses occur.**

There is no autonomous firewall that:
- Intercepts transactions at the wallet level
- Runs composite intelligence from multiple sources in parallel
- Simulates transaction outcomes before execution
- Blocks confirmed scams automatically
- Records forensic evidence immutably on-chain

---

## Solution

**ShieldBot is an autonomous transaction firewall for BNB Chain that protects users from honeypots, rug pulls, and malicious contracts in real-time.**

### How It Works

```
User initiates swap on PancakeSwap
         ↓
ShieldBot intercepts via Chrome Extension (before MetaMask sees it)
         ↓
Parallel intelligence gathering (6 sources, <2 seconds):
  • GoPlus: Contract verification, scam flags, bytecode analysis
  • Honeypot.is: Buy/sell simulation, tax detection
  • DexScreener: Liquidity depth, pair age, volume anomalies
  • Ethos Network: Wallet reputation scoring
  • Tenderly: Pre-execution simulation (success/revert, asset deltas)
  • BscScan: Deployment age, transaction history
         ↓
RiskEngine computes composite ShieldScore (0-100):
  • Structural risk (40%): Verification, mint, proxy, ownership
  • Market risk (25%): Liquidity, volume, FDV ratio
  • Behavioral risk (20%): Wallet reputation, scam flags
  • Honeypot risk (15%): Confirmed honeypot, sell tax >50%
         ↓
Verdict determination:
  • HIGH RISK (71+): AUTO-BLOCK with full-screen red modal
  • MEDIUM RISK (31-70): WARNING overlay (user can proceed/cancel)
  • LOW RISK (0-30): ALLOW silently (no friction)
         ↓
For risky transactions: Upload forensic report to BNB Greenfield
         ↓
Transaction proceeds/rejected based on verdict + user choice
```

### Visual Proof of Concept

**Extension BLOCK in Action:**

ShieldBot's most powerful feature is its ability to hard-block dangerous transactions. When analyzing a honeypot token with 99% sell tax, the extension displays a full-screen red modal showing:
- Risk Score: 85/100 (HIGH RISK)
- Critical flags explaining WHY it's dangerous (honeypot confirmed, cannot sell after buying, extreme sell tax)
- The transaction is completely blocked - users cannot proceed even if they choose to

**Result:** The user's funds are protected BEFORE the transaction executes. This is fundamentally different from post-mortem block explorers or warnings that users can ignore.

**Telegram Bot Intelligence:**

The Telegram bot provides instant security analysis with token identification:
```
🟢 ShieldBot Intelligence Report

Token: Wrapped BNB (WBNB)
Address: 0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c
Risk Level: LOW (5/100)

✓ Contract verified on BscScan
✓ Ownership renounced
✓ High liquidity: $500M+
✓ 5+ years old, 50M+ transactions
```

Users can scan any address in seconds without technical knowledge. The bot is live at [@shieldbot_bnb_bot](https://t.me/shieldbot_bnb_bot) for judges to test.

**BNB Greenfield Immutable Storage:**

High-risk transaction reports are stored on BNB Greenfield as public, immutable JSON objects. This creates a permanent, community-verifiable database of dangerous contracts on BNB Chain. Each report includes:
- Complete risk analysis with category breakdowns
- Timestamp and contract address
- All critical flags and danger signals
- Public URL accessible to anyone

### Key Innovations

1. **Real-Time Transaction Interception**
   - Chrome extension wraps wallet provider's `request()` method
   - Catches `eth_sendTransaction` BEFORE wallet signature
   - Works with MetaMask, Rabby, Coinbase Wallet (EIP-6963 compatible)
   - Cannot be bypassed (runs in page context, `world: MAIN`)

2. **Composite ShieldScore**
   - Weighted scoring from 4 categories (structural, market, behavioral, honeypot)
   - Escalation rules for confirmed rug patterns
   - Reduction rules for verified safe contracts
   - 75%+ confidence threshold for auto-block

3. **BNB Greenfield Forensic Reports**
   - Immutable on-chain storage of high-risk transaction analysis
   - Public URLs for community verification
   - Tamper-proof evidence trail
   - Enables pattern recognition across scams

4. **Pre-Execution Simulation**
   - Tenderly API simulates transaction before signing
   - Predicts success/revert, gas usage, asset deltas
   - Detects failed internal calls and reentrancy
   - Shows "what will happen" before it happens

5. **Multi-Channel Delivery**
   - Chrome Extension: Real-time firewall for dApp users
   - Telegram Bot: Quick contract scans via @shieldbot_bnb_bot
   - REST API: Integration point for wallets/dApps

## Impact

### User Protection
- **Prevents losses BEFORE they occur** (not just alerts)
- **Zero-knowledge protection**: Users don't need to understand bytecode, liquidity locks, or honeypot mechanisms
- **Frictionless for safe transactions**: PancakeSwap, 1inch, verified DEXs pass through silently
- **Transparent risk explanations**: AI-powered analysis explains WHY a contract is dangerous

### Ecosystem Benefits
- **Reduces scam success rate** → Fewer victims → Less incentive for scammers
- **Builds trust in BNB Chain DeFi** → More users willing to explore new tokens
- **Immutable scam database** on BNB Greenfield → Community-verifiable threat intelligence
- **Open-source security layer** → Other projects can integrate ShieldBot API

### Measurable Outcomes (Projected)
- **$10M+ in losses prevented** in first year (based on blocking 1 in 500 risky swaps)
- **50,000+ scans performed** via Telegram bot and extension
- **5,000+ forensic reports** stored on BNB Greenfield
- **95% reduction in false positives** vs. single-source scanners (via composite scoring)

### Current Traction
- Live Telegram bot: [@shieldbot_bnb_bot](https://t.me/shieldbot_bnb_bot)
- Chrome extension deployed and tested
- BNB Greenfield integration live (testnet)
- Multi-source intelligence pipeline operational

## BNB Chain Integration

### Why BNB Chain?

ShieldBot is purpose-built for BNB Chain because:

1. **High Trading Volume**
   - BNB Chain processes 3M+ daily transactions
   - PancakeSwap is the 2nd largest DEX globally
   - High activity = high scam exposure

2. **Easy Token Deployment**
   - Low gas fees enable rapid token launches
   - Many unverified/new contracts daily
   - Perfect environment for honeypots and rug pulls

3. **BNB Greenfield Native Integration**
   - Decentralized storage for forensic reports
   - Lower costs than traditional storage
   - Built-in redundancy and immutability
   - Native to BNB ecosystem

4. **opBNB Support**
   - Layer-2 scalability for high-frequency scans
   - Sub-cent transaction costs
   - Future: Real-time on-chain verification contract

### BNB-Specific Features

- **BSC Mainnet Scanning**: Contract verification via BscScan API
- **opBNB RPC Support**: Dual-chain analysis (BSC + opBNB)
- **BNB Greenfield Storage**: Immutable forensic reports (using greenfield-python-sdk)
- **PancakeSwap Integration**: Whitelisted router for fast-path approval
- **BNB Ecosystem Data**: Liquidity lock detection (PinkLock, Unicrypt on BSC)

---

## 4. Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

**Technical Constraints:**
- **Off-Chain Analysis Required**: Real-time performance (<2s) necessitates off-chain computation. Full on-chain verification would be too slow and expensive for per-transaction analysis.
- **API Dependency**: Core functionality requires external API availability (GoPlus, Honeypot.is, DexScreener, etc.). Graceful fallbacks exist, but total API failure would reduce effectiveness.
- **Browser Extension Only**: Currently supports Chrome/Brave via Manifest V3. Firefox and mobile wallet integration pending.
- **BSC/opBNB Focus**: Multi-chain support limited to BNB ecosystem. Ethereum, Polygon, and other chains not yet supported.

**Security & Risk:**
- **False Negatives Possible**: Sophisticated scams using novel techniques may evade detection. Composite scoring reduces but does not eliminate this risk.
- **Whitelisted Router Trust**: PancakeSwap and major DEX routers are fast-tracked. Compromise of these routers (unlikely but possible) would bypass ShieldBot.
- **API Key Management**: Users must secure their own API keys for optional features (Tenderly, Greenfield uploads). No centralized key management.
- **Test Coverage**: Core features tested (API, risk scoring, calldata, ownership), but E2E extension testing requires manual verification.

**User Experience:**
- **Setup Friction**: Local deployment requires Python 3.11+, multiple API keys, and extension sideloading. Not yet one-click install.
- **Rate Limiting**: BscScan free tier limits to 5 req/sec. High-volume users may experience delays.
- **No Mobile Support**: Chrome extension architecture incompatible with mobile. Mobile wallet SDK integration required.

**Data & Scalability:**
- **BNB Greenfield Costs**: Storage costs scale with usage. Currently sustainable for high-risk reports only (score ≥50).
- **No Historical Analysis**: Each scan is point-in-time. No trending or pattern detection across multiple scans of same contract.
- **Centralized Bot Hosting**: Telegram bot runs on single VPS. No redundancy or load balancing yet.

### Short-Term Future Work (Next 3-6 Months)

**Immediate Priorities (Q2 2026):**
- Deploy ShieldBotVerifier.sol to BSC Mainnet for optional on-chain scan recording
- Add Firefox extension support (Manifest V3 compatible)
- Implement caching layer for common contract queries (reduce API calls)
- Add batch scanning API endpoint (analyze multiple addresses in one call)
- Create browser extension store listings (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons)

**User Experience Improvements:**
- One-click installer script (auto-configures .env with default settings)
- Hosted API endpoint (users don't need to run local server)
- Mobile wallet SDK for Trust Wallet and SafePal integration
- Desktop notifications for high-risk transaction attempts

**Security Enhancements:**
- ML-based anomaly detection trained on BNB Greenfield historical reports
- Cross-reference multiple honeypot detection APIs (reduce false negatives)
- Real-time smart contract upgrade monitoring (detect proxy changes)
- Community reporting system with reputation staking

**Scalability & Reliability:**
- Redis caching for frequent contract lookups
- Load balancer for Telegram bot (multi-instance deployment)
- Failover RPC endpoints (automatic BSC node switching on failure)
- Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards for monitoring

**Aligned with Existing Roadmap:**
- Phase 2 (Q2 2026): Extension marketplace deployment, mobile SDK, historical analysis
- Phase 3 (Q3 2026): On-chain verification contract, DAO governance, decentralized oracle
- Phase 4 (Q4 2026): Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum)

### Known Issues & Mitigations

**Issue:** BscScan API occasionally returns 429 (rate limit exceeded)
**Mitigation:** Implemented 0.25s delay between calls + exponential backoff retry logic

**Issue:** Extension occasionally fails to intercept transactions on page reload
**Mitigation:** inject.js runs at document_start to ensure provider wrapping before dApp loads

**Issue:** Greenfield uploads fail if wallet has insufficient BNB for gas
**Mitigation:** Graceful fallback - report still generated and returned to user, just not stored on-chain

**Issue:** Telegram bot response time >5s for first scan after idle period (cold start)
**Mitigation:** Keep-alive ping every 10 minutes to maintain API connection pool
